Spaghetti is my favorite meal, so I always like to save the longest piece for last...
Task

Write some spaghetti code to help me know which piece of spaghetti is the longest.

Try NOT to write spaghetti code that looks like spaghetti code !

NOTES

    I eat a special (very hard to find) brand of Spaghetti where each piece has a unique uppercase letter ID
    If multiple spaghetti pieces are longest, just return any one of them (all spaghetti tastes the same)
    If the plate has no spaghetti then return empty string
    All of my plates are rectangular
    Plates can have any (non alphabetic) background pattern on them
