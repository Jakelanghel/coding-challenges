Challenge from [Code wars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5264d2b162488dc400000001/python)

The drawing below gives an idea of how to cut a given "true" rectangle into squares ("true" rectangle meaning that the two dimensions are different).

You will be given two dimensions

    a positive integer length
    a positive integer width

You will return a collection or a string (depending on the language; Shell bash, PowerShell, Pascal and Fortran return a string) with the size of each of the squares.

Examples:

## Example:

```
  sqInRect(5, 3) should return [3, 2, 1, 1]
  sqInRect(3, 5) should return [3, 2, 1, 1]

```
